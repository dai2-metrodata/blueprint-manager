In this step, you'll generate SQL to revoke unnecessary grants from the PUBLIC role. Since PUBLIC is automatically granted to every user, any privilege on PUBLIC is effectively given to all users in the account.

**Account Context:** Execute from the target account with SECURITYADMIN role.

## Why is this important?

The PUBLIC role is one of the most common sources of excessive access:
- **Warehouse USAGE** — Any user can consume compute credits
- **Database/Schema USAGE** — Any user can see object metadata and structure
- **SELECT on tables/views** — Data exposed to everyone in the account
- **USAGE on functions/procedures** — Any user can execute shared code

These grants often accumulate from quick demos, testing, or legacy configurations and are rarely reviewed.

## Prerequisites

- Task 1 (RBAC Assessment) completed — specifically Step 1.2 (Audit Privilege Grants)
- PUBLIC grant exceptions documented
- Agreement from stakeholders on which grants to revoke

## Key Concepts

**PUBLIC Role Behavior**
- Every user automatically holds the PUBLIC role — it cannot be revoked
- Privileges granted to PUBLIC are inherited by all users
- PUBLIC role grants bypass the RBAC hierarchy entirely

**Exception Handling**
Some PUBLIC grants are intentional:
- Sample data databases (SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA)
- Shared reference databases
- Utility functions used by all users

Configure exceptions via `rbac_public_exceptions` to exclude these from revocation.

## Best Practices

- Default to revoking all PUBLIC grants, then add back only what's needed
- Document the business justification for every exception
- Re-audit PUBLIC grants after any new database or schema creation
- Consider network policies as an additional layer on top of PUBLIC restrictions

## How to Test

1. Before revoking: run `SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE PUBLIC;` and save the output
2. After revoking: run the same command and confirm only exceptions remain
3. Test with a user who only has PUBLIC role to verify they cannot access restricted objects

### Configuration Questions

#### Do you want to revoke unnecessary grants from the PUBLIC role? (`rbac_restrict_public`: multi-select)
**What is this asking?**
Choose whether to generate REVOKE statements that remove unnecessary privileges
from the PUBLIC role. The PUBLIC role is automatically granted to every user in
the account.

**Why does this matter?**
Any privilege granted to PUBLIC is effectively granted to every user. This is
one of the most common RBAC misconfigurations. Common issues include:
- Warehouse USAGE on PUBLIC (all users can consume compute)
- Database/schema USAGE on PUBLIC (all users can see object metadata)
- SELECT on tables/views via PUBLIC (data exposed to everyone)

**Options explained:**
- **Yes**: Generate REVOKE statements for PUBLIC role grants (with exceptions
  you configure). Review the generated SQL carefully before executing.
- **No**: Skip PUBLIC role restriction. Choose this if your PUBLIC grants
  are intentional and reviewed.

**Recommendation:** Yes. Even if some PUBLIC grants are intentional, this step
helps you review and confirm each one explicitly.

**Options:**
- Yes
- No

#### Which databases or schemas should remain accessible via the PUBLIC role? (`rbac_public_exceptions`: list)
**What is this asking?**
List any databases or schemas that should keep their PUBLIC role grants.
These are excluded from the REVOKE statements generated in the
"Restrict PUBLIC Role" step.

**Why does this matter?**
Some PUBLIC grants are intentional — for example, a shared reference database
that all users need to query, or the SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA database. Listing
exceptions prevents accidentally revoking access that is by design.

**Examples:**
- `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA` — Sample data database
- `REFERENCE_DATA` — Shared lookup tables
- `UTIL_DB.PUBLIC` — Shared utility functions

**Recommendation:** Keep exceptions to a minimum. Each exception is a surface
area that all users can access. Document the business reason for each exception.
