In this step, you'll generate diagnostic queries that detect stale access — unused roles, dormant users with active privileges, and users who have never logged in but hold role grants. Stale access is a security risk because it provides attack surface without business value.

**Account Context:** Execute these queries from the target account with ACCOUNTADMIN role.

## Why is this important?

Stale access accumulates over time as employees change roles, leave the organization, or projects are decommissioned. Risks include:
- **Orphaned credentials** — Dormant users may have credentials that are compromised without detection
- **Unused roles** — Roles with no active users consuming them indicate RBAC drift
- **Compliance violations** — Most frameworks (SOC 2, HIPAA) require periodic access review and removal of stale grants

## Prerequisites

- Account accessible with ACCOUNTADMIN role
- SNOWFLAKE database IMPORTED PRIVILEGES granted
- LOGIN_HISTORY data available (up to 365 days)

## Key Concepts

**Dormant Users**
Users who have not logged in for 90+ days but still have active role grants. These accounts should be reviewed for deactivation or privilege removal.

**Unused Roles**
Roles that exist in the hierarchy but are not granted to any user, or are only granted to users who haven't logged in recently.

**Last Login Analysis**
Snowflake's LOGIN_HISTORY view provides login records for up to 365 days. Users are bucketed into:
- **Active** (<30 days since last login)
- **Stale** (30-90 days)
- **Dormant** (>90 days)
- **Never** (no login record)

## Best Practices

- Disable dormant users (`ALTER USER SET DISABLED = TRUE`) rather than dropping them immediately
- Revoke role grants from dormant users before disabling
- Keep disabled users for 30-90 day retention period, then drop
- Run stale access detection monthly

## How to Test

1. Run the dormant users query — verify results against your HR/identity records
2. Cross-reference unused roles with the role hierarchy audit
3. Confirm "never logged in" users are not pending onboarding

### Configuration Questions

#### What scope should the RBAC audit cover? (`rbac_audit_scope`: multi-select)
**What is this asking?**
Choose whether to audit role-based access controls across the entire Snowflake
account or limit the audit to specific data product role hierarchies.

**Why does this matter?**
A full account audit examines every role, grant, and user assignment in the
account. This is thorough but may produce a large volume of findings. Scoping
to specific data products focuses the audit on the role hierarchies created by
Data Product Setup (ADMIN, CREATE, WRITE, RBAC, READ and their database roles).

**Options explained:**
- **Full Account**: Audit all roles, grants, and user assignments. Recommended
  for initial hardening or compliance reviews.
- **Specific Data Products**: Audit only the role hierarchies matching the
  provided data product prefixes. Useful for targeted reviews after changes.

**Recommendation:** Use "Full Account" for your first RBAC hardening pass,
then switch to "Specific Data Products" for periodic maintenance reviews.

**More Information:**
* [Access Control Overview](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview)

**Options:**
- Full Account
- Specific Data Products

#### Which data product prefixes should the RBAC audit cover? (`rbac_target_prefixes`: list)
**What is this asking?**
Provide the role name prefixes for the data products you want to audit. These
are the prefixes used when creating data product roles (e.g., SALES_ANALYTICS_PROD,
FINANCE_REPORTING_DEV).

**Why does this matter?**
When the audit scope is set to "Specific Data Products", these prefixes filter
the audit queries to only examine roles matching these patterns. This keeps
findings focused and actionable.

**How to find your prefixes:**
Run `SHOW ROLES LIKE '%_ADMIN';` and look for your data product ADMIN roles.
The prefix is everything before `_ADMIN`.

**Examples:**
- `SALES_ANALYTICS_PROD` (Single Account: domain_name_env)
- `FINANCE_REPORTING` (Multi-Account Environment-based: domain_name)
- `CLAIMS_DEV` (Multi-Account Domain-based: name_env)
- `INVENTORY` (Multi-Account Domain+Env: name)

**Recommendation:** Include all data products that were set up using the
Data Product Setup blueprint.
