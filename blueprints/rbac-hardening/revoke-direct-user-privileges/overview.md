In this step, you'll generate queries to discover and remediate privileges granted directly to users instead of to roles. Direct user grants bypass the RBAC hierarchy and create shadow access that is invisible to role-based audits.

**Account Context:** Execute from the target account with SECURITYADMIN role.

## Why is this important?

Snowflake allows privileges to be granted directly to users (e.g., `GRANT SELECT ON TABLE X TO USER jsmith`). This is an anti-pattern because:
- **Invisible to role audits** — Role hierarchy reviews miss user-level grants
- **Unmanageable at scale** — Each user must be individually managed
- **SCIM incompatible** — Identity providers manage role membership, not user-level privileges
- **Hard to revoke** — When a user changes teams, each direct grant must be individually revoked

## Prerequisites

- Task 1 (RBAC Assessment) completed — Step 1.2 identifies direct user grants
- Data Product functional roles exist (from Data Product Setup)
- Understanding of which roles each user's direct privileges should migrate to

## Key Concepts

**Role-Based vs. User-Based Access**
| Approach | Manageable | Auditable | SCIM Compatible |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Grant to Role | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Grant to User | No | Partially | No |

**Migration Pattern**
For each direct user grant:
1. Identify the correct role (READ, WRITE, CREATE, or ADMIN)
2. Verify the role already has the equivalent privilege
3. Revoke the direct user grant
4. Grant the role to the user (if not already granted)

## Best Practices

- Never grant privileges directly to users in production
- Use functional roles (READ/WRITE/CREATE/ADMIN) for all data access
- Use database roles (SC_R/SC_W/SC_C) for schema-level access when functional roles are too broad
- Audit direct user grants quarterly

## How to Test

1. Run the discovery query to find all direct user grants
2. For each grant, verify the target role has equivalent access
3. Revoke the direct grant and confirm the user can still access via their role

### Configuration Questions

#### What scope should the RBAC audit cover? (`rbac_audit_scope`: multi-select)
**What is this asking?**
Choose whether to audit role-based access controls across the entire Snowflake
account or limit the audit to specific data product role hierarchies.

**Why does this matter?**
A full account audit examines every role, grant, and user assignment in the
account. This is thorough but may produce a large volume of findings. Scoping
to specific data products focuses the audit on the role hierarchies created by
Data Product Setup (ADMIN, CREATE, WRITE, RBAC, READ and their database roles).

**Options explained:**
- **Full Account**: Audit all roles, grants, and user assignments. Recommended
  for initial hardening or compliance reviews.
- **Specific Data Products**: Audit only the role hierarchies matching the
  provided data product prefixes. Useful for targeted reviews after changes.

**Recommendation:** Use "Full Account" for your first RBAC hardening pass,
then switch to "Specific Data Products" for periodic maintenance reviews.

**More Information:**
* [Access Control Overview](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview)

**Options:**
- Full Account
- Specific Data Products

#### Which data product prefixes should the RBAC audit cover? (`rbac_target_prefixes`: list)
**What is this asking?**
Provide the role name prefixes for the data products you want to audit. These
are the prefixes used when creating data product roles (e.g., SALES_ANALYTICS_PROD,
FINANCE_REPORTING_DEV).

**Why does this matter?**
When the audit scope is set to "Specific Data Products", these prefixes filter
the audit queries to only examine roles matching these patterns. This keeps
findings focused and actionable.

**How to find your prefixes:**
Run `SHOW ROLES LIKE '%_ADMIN';` and look for your data product ADMIN roles.
The prefix is everything before `_ADMIN`.

**Examples:**
- `SALES_ANALYTICS_PROD` (Single Account: domain_name_env)
- `FINANCE_REPORTING` (Multi-Account Environment-based: domain_name)
- `CLAIMS_DEV` (Multi-Account Domain-based: name_env)
- `INVENTORY` (Multi-Account Domain+Env: name)

**Recommendation:** Include all data products that were set up using the
Data Product Setup blueprint.
